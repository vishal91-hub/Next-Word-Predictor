# Next-Word-Predictor
This project implements a Next Word Predictor using TensorFlow, leveraging Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The model is trained on a story of  junglebook and is capable of predicting the next word given a sequence of input words. 

Technologies Used:
TensorFlow: Deep learning framework used for model implementation.
Python: Programming language used for development.

Future Improvements:
Explore advanced LSTM architectures and model hyperparameters for better performance.
Incorporate attention mechanisms to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence.
Enhance user interface with additional features such as autocomplete suggestions and error handling.
